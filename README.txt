Linux / Android version:

The processing of the statistics can be time consuming, so you can play with the command "bash antoniovandre_mathgame ne", where only the log file will be saved, and, when not using the device, execute "bash antoniovandre_mathgame oe" to only process the statistics.

There are many other options avaliable when editing fonts.
